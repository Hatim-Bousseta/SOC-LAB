# SOC-LAB
A complete SOC lab with Wazuh, ELK, Zeek, pfSense, Snort, TheHive, Cortex, MISP, and Shuffle.

#  Advanced Security Operation Center (SOC) Lab

This lab is a fully functional, open-source-based Security Operation Center (SOC) environment designed for learning, simulation, and hands-on practice in threat detection, investigation, and response.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The project integrates a wide range of tools and platforms to simulate realistic blue team and red team operations. It includes endpoint agents, SIEM components, SOAR, firewall, IDS, threat intel platforms, and attack emulation.

##  Architecture Components

### ðŸ”¸ Endpoints (Wazuh Agents)
- **Windows Server 2016** â€“ Domain Controller
- **Windows Client**
- **Ubuntu Client**
- **Parrot OS Client** â€“ Linux workstation for diversity

### ðŸ”¸ Monitoring & Analysis
- **Wazuh** â€“ Agent management and log analysis
- **ELK Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana)** â€“ Visual dashboard and storage

### ðŸ”¸ Network Security
- **pfSense Firewall**
- **Snort IDS** integrated within pfSense
- **Zeek** â€“ Network traffic analysis
- **Custom Zeek detection scripts** â€“ Alert generation based on suspicious patterns

### ðŸ”¸ Threat Simulation
- **Kali Linux** â€“ Attacker machine for red team scenarios (penetration testing, malware, brute-force, etc.)

### ðŸ”¸ SOAR & Threat Intelligence
- **Shuffle SOAR** â€“ Automation of security workflows
  - Integrated with:
    - **Gmail API** â€“ Alert notifications
    - **VirusTotal API** â€“ File/URL intelligence enrichment
- **TheHive** â€“ Incident response platform
- **Cortex** â€“ Analyzer engine connected to TheHive
- **MISP** â€“ Threat intelligence sharing (feeds and IOCs)
